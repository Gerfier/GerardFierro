Updated Personal Site 

Hosted on Github Pages

Portfolio and projects will be updated when needed

Things to update:

-In portfolio there is an option to send a message to my email. This functionality is still not fully integrated.
I might use "formspree.io"

-Some of the projects do not have all pages created, the case for PetUs and GrabCafe.

-PetUs still does not validate login form to relocate user to another made up page.
